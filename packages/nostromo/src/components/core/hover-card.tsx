/**
 * A preview that appears on hover: a user card behind a mention, a repository
 * summary behind a link.
 *
 * Not a `Tooltip`. A tooltip labels something in a few words and is announced as
 * the element's description; a hover card holds real content, including links
 * you can move the pointer into.
 *
 * It opens on hover and on keyboard focus, but its content is not reachable by
 * keyboard beyond that, and it never opens on touch. So it has to stay
 * supplementary: everything inside must also be available somewhere else. Radix
 * marks it `aria-hidden` for that reason, which is correct and means a screen
 * reader will not see it at all.
