# Code of Conduct

## 🎯 Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## 📋 Expected Behavior

### ✅ **Positive Examples**
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism with humility
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members

### ❌ **Unacceptable Behavior**
- Use of sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## 🛡️ Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## 🌍 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## 🚨 Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [security@nostromo-ui.dev](mailto:security@nostromo-ui.dev). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## ⚖️ Enforcement

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
