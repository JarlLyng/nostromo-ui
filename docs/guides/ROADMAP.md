## 🎯 Current Status

**Current focus**: getting the first release onto npm.

The library is feature-complete and tested, the docs site is deployed, and the
publishing pipeline works end to end. Nothing is installable from the registry
yet.

### 🧪 Community feedback - not started

This section previously claimed a completed beta phase with 10+ testers, 20+
issues of feedback, testing across 5+ project setups and confirmed API
stability. None of that happened. The repository has no external users, and the
one bug report it has received came from someone finding the docs site broken.

Removing the claim rather than restating it: a roadmap that marks unstarted work
as done is worse than no roadmap, because it stops you looking at the thing that
actually needs doing.

Real prerequisites for gathering feedback:

- [ ] Publish to npm so the library can be installed at all
- [ ] Confirm the documented setup works in a project nobody here wrote
- [ ] Decide whether the API is stable enough to ask people to build on
